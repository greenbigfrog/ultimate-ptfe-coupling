There are a couple Magnet based PTFE coupling systems out there, to be used for 3D Printing. But they aren't necessarily all compatible, or allow for easily setting the magnet size.
This isn't in quite a perfect usable enduser state, but everything should be rather self explanatory.


Inspiration taken from:
- The general concept: https://www.printables.com/model/32368-join-ptfe-tubes-together-magnetically
- The idea of having a socket on the drybox: https://www.printables.com/model/78169-magnetic-pfte-coupler-dockterminator and https://www.printables.com/model/85278-drybox-sockets-for-magnetically-coupled-ptfe-tubes
